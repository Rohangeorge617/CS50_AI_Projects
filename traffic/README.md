For the model, I used simpe models with a small number of parameters, and then I slowly started to add more layers to increase the capability of the model. The models were trained with the training and testing data, and then I compared  the accuracy of the model with the training data vs. the testing data to see how close the accuracies were to each other and how high they were. I wanted to have accuracies that were both very high (accurate), and how close they were to each other (precise).

What didn't go well for me was when the model's loss on testing data was higher than that of the training data, causing the training data to be overfitted, which means that the testing data won't be represented well. To deal with this issue, I reducted the model's complexity, but made sure it wasn't too simple, as I did not want high loss on both sets of data. I tried to find the most optimal model capacity to get the best results.

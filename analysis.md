 Layer 4, Head 4

This attention head seems to pay attention to the object of the preposition. For example, in the sentence "Rohan fed [MASK] to the dog", the square between 'to' and 'dog' is the lighest in its row. Same for the sentence "Jackson threw [MASK] at the neighbors". The square between 'at' and 'neighbors' is very light.

Example Sentences:
- Rohan fed [MASK] to the dog.
- Jackson threw [MASK] at the neighbors.

Layer 2, Head 12

This attention head pays attention to important words, especially adjectives and nouns that are modied or receive an action. In the sentence "Daniel [MASK] why the orange dog never grew, 'orange' was the brighest of the squares, and the brighter squares formed a diagonal path, with the noun 'dog' also being a bright square. In the sentence "The scary teacher [MASK] the students", 'scary' was a bright square, along with the other squares on the diagonal path such as nouns like teacher and students. 

Example Sentences:
- Daniel [MASK] why the orange dog never grew.
- The scary teacher [MASK] the students.
